## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `torch`, `mosek`, `gurobipy`, `ortools`

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the repository's root directory.
2. Create a virtual environment using venv
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```
3. Activate your environment
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Obtain licenses for MOSEK and Gurobi and install those licenses on the machine you will be running this repository on.
6. Clone the [KaMIS project](https://github.com/KarlsruheMIS/KaMIS) and build a copy of the ReduMIS program. Place the program in the `external` folder of this repository.
7. Run the benchmarking suite:
   ```bash
   python benchmark.py
   ```


## Configuration

### Graph Import

Specify the directories containing the graph data by uncommenting the appropriate lines in the `graph_directories` list within `benchmark.py`. For example:

```python
graph_directories = [
    "./graphs/satlib/m403",
    "./graphs/satlib/m411",
    "./graphs/satlib/m418",
]
```

### Solver Configuration

Define the solvers you want to use in the `solvers` list. Uncomment the solvers you want to benchmark and specify their parameters. For example:

```python
solvers = [
    {
        "name": "Gurobi",
        "class": GurobiMIS,
        "params": {"time_limit": 100},
    },
    {
        "name": "CPSAT",
        "class": CPSATMIS,
        "params": {"time_limit": 30},
    },
]
```

## Running the Script

Run the script to start the benchmarking process:

```bash
python benchmark.py
```

### Checkpoints and Final Results

The script saves intermediate results at regular intervals defined by `SOLUTION_SAVE_INTERVAL`. The final results are saved at the end of the benchmarking process. Output files are saved as CSV files named `zero_to_stage_{current_stage}_of_{total_stages}_total_stages.csv`.

## Customization

### Initializers

The script includes optional initializers for the solvers:

1. **Default initializer**: Uniform distribution.
2. **Degree-based initializer**: Initialize values based on node degrees.
3. **SDP-based initializer**: Initialize values based on SDP solutions.

Uncomment the relevant section to use an initializer.

### Example: Degree-based Initializer

```python
mean_vector = []
degrees = dict(graph["data"].degree())

# Find the maximum degree
max_degree = max(degrees.values())

for _, degree in graph["data"].degree():
    degree_init = 1 - degree / max_degree
    mean_vector.append(degree_init)

min_degree_initialization = max(mean_vector)

for i in range(len(mean_vector)):
    mean_vector[i] = mean_vector[i] / min_degree_initialization

solver_instance.value_initializer = lambda _: torch.normal(
    mean=torch.Tensor(mean_vector), std=solver["params"]["std"]
)
```

### Example: SDP-based Initializer

```python
solver_instance.value_initializer = lambda _: torch.normal(
    mean=initializations[graph["name"]]["SDP_solution"],
    std=torch.sqrt(torch.ones((len(initializations[graph["name"]]["SDP_solution"])))) * solver["params"]["std"]
)
```

## Output

The script outputs a CSV file containing the results for each graph and solver, including solution sizes and time taken for each solver.

## Notes

- Ensure the graph data and solver implementations are correctly set up and accessible.
- Adjust the `SOLUTION_SAVE_INTERVAL` as needed to control the frequency of checkpoint saves.
- The benchmarking process may be time-consuming depending on the number and size of graphs, and the solvers used.
- Large datasets that exceed local RAM can be run using the ```benchmark_large_graphs.py``` script.
